Amanda Greenwood is a project archivist at Union College in Schenectady, New York. She earned an MSIS in Archives and Records Administration from the University at Albany, State University of New York and an ALM in English from Harvard University. Before becoming an archivist, she worked as an adjunct lecturer in South Korea and the United States from 2006-2020 and taught courses on hard-boiled fiction, film noir, modernism, and Irish literature. Since 2008, she has been a board member of the James Joyce Society of Korea and the English language editor of the societyâ€™s journal, the *James Joyce Journal*. Her research interests focus on the intersection of postcolonialism and masculinity in the works of James Joyce, linguistics and gender in hard-boiled fiction, trauma and emotions in archival work, and web archiving labor and maintenance.
